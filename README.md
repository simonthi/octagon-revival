# octagon-revival

A repository to host and collect student contributions for the octagon variable revival project hosted at the Basisjahr LAB course @HAW Hamburg.
The octagon variable revival project is based on a wood type by Edwin Allen, which was first shown in George Nesbitt’s 1838 “First Premium Wood Types Cut by Machinery”.
