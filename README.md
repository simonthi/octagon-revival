# octagon-revival

A repository to host and collect student contributions for the collaborative octagon variable revival font project hosted at the Basisjahr Type Design LAB course @HAW Hamburg in 2022 under the guidance of Prof. Pierre Pané-Farré and Simon Thiefes.
The octagon variable revival project is based on a wood type by Edwin Allen, which was first shown in George Nesbitt’s 1838 “First Premium Wood Types Cut by Machinery”.
